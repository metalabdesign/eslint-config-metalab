    // This rule is aimed at ensuring all return statements either specify a
    // value or don't specify a value. Since JavaScript offers no typing
    // it is impossible to check a function actually returns what it intends to.

    // It is considered by many to be best practice to never omit curly braces

    // Some functions are just complex by their nature and splitting them up is
    // more work than its necessary. Although this rule is useful in theory it

    // The switch statement in JavaScript is one of the more error-prone

    // 'Magic numbers' are numbers that occur multiple time in code without an

    // Don't use `new` for side-effects. Since `new` always creates an object

    // There are three primitive types in JavaScript that have wrapper objects:

    // Assignment to variables declared as function parameters can be misleading
    // and lead to confusing behavior, as modifying function parameters will

    // Having an assignment expression in a `return` statement results in

    // The comma operator includes multiple expressions where only one is
